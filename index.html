  <h2>Solving Waste with Waste — Patented Technology to Transform Ocean and Solid Waste into Durable Housing Materials</h2>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      We are using the simplest and most direct method, through non-commercial technology integration, to solve global solid waste problems and provide affordable high-quality housing for the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      With just USD 3,000, we can build a high-quality, zero-pollution, B1 fire-rated house with 25–30 MPa strength for those in need.
    </p>
    <p>
      With USD 500 million (one-sixth of which is used to build a mobile operating platform), we can clean up 100,000 tons of Pacific plastic waste in 100 working days and generate 300,000 cubic meters of landfilling material. The platform can also be relocated to clean up other marine zones.
    </p>

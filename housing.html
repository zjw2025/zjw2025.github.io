    <p><strong>Is it their fault to be poor?</strong> Do they deserve to live in such conditions?</p>
    <p>Shouldn't we take responsibility and help them in any way we can? Are you doing something?</p>
    <p>Follow me. With my technology, we can turn solid waste into affordable, high-quality housing for those in need — while solving pollution at the same time.</p>
    <p>In our system, waste is not garbage — it's a valuable resource.</p>
    <p>Join me, and let us tackle two global challenges with one invention: my soon-to-be-filed international patent.</p>

    <p><strong>UN Report Highlights:</strong> The United Nations has issued warnings about the global housing crisis, particularly in slum areas where billions live in unsafe, unsanitary conditions. Without affordable, scalable solutions, the crisis will deepen, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. Our technology offers a path forward by transforming plastic waste into dignified, resilient housing for the poor.</p>

      <h2>Our DIY Housing Solution for the Poor</h2>
      <p>Our approach combines modular molds with patented eco-binder technology. A simple and cost-effective system includes a small shredder and mixer, enabling families to directly build houses themselves.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with environmental NGOs and sustainability funds, we provide molds and technical guidance through volunteer support. Families can build their homes with dignity.</p>
      <p>With just 3 people and 5–7 days, a durable and dignified house like the one shown here can be completed. This is not just shelter — it’s empowerment through innovation.</p>

      <h2>UN: Housing Crisis News</h2>
      <p>The United Nations has issued a warning about the global housing crisis, especially in slum areas where billions live in unsafe, unsanitary conditions. Without affordable, scalable solutions, the crisis will deepen, disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations. Our technology transforms a wide range of solid waste into dignified, resilient housing for the poor — offering a path forward.</p>

      <h2>DIY Housing Innovation</h2>
      <p>Our approach combines modular molds with our patented eco-binder technology. The system is simple and cost-effective — including a small shredder and mixer — so families can build their own homes directly.</p>

      <p>We collaborate with environmental NGOs and sustainable development funds to provide molds, basic equipment, and low- or no-interest loans. Volunteers offer training and support, empowering families to build dignified homes with their own hands.</p>

      <p>With just three people and 5–7 days, families can construct strong, beautiful homes like the one shown. This is more than shelter — it's the power of innovation made real.</p>
